      <description>As a human in an uncertain world, one always has to embrace learning and adapting. It is the essence of life and success. Heraclitus said it best:
“Change is the only constant in life”
The problem with a lot of modalities and assumptions is that we as a species tend to crowd think and use our most recent experiences as a reference for the future. Put simply we project the future in a linear fashion when the truth is that the future will be variable in ways we cannot predict.</description>

      <description>Mark Twain once said that “history never repeats itself, but it often rhymes.” This is as true now as it was then. I love to study history because if you know where we have been, you will be able to see the precursors of trends in where we are going.
When you go back in time and look at the maturation process of industries, from concept to maturation, they typically mature in three waves.</description>

      <description>How business and mission are conducted in the space ecosystem has been static for decades. Progress has been primarily driven by Governmental money and the finicky focus of politics. This has resulted in the stagnation of humanity’s progress toward the stars.
The good news is that this dynamic is changing rapidly. With the influx of private capital and focus, we are rapidly evolving the space ecosystem into a more dynamic and efficient organism.</description>
