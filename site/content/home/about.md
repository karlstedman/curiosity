***My path has been anything but conventional.*** I have an innate curiosity to learn as much as I can about all sorts of subjects. This has led to some amazing experiences and many learning lessons.  These experiences coupled with my thirst for knowledge have given me an unconventional perspective with a foundation across multiple disciplines including (but not limited to) business, investing, economics, history, space, human psychology and more. 


I share this ***unconventional perspective*** in the media engagements below.
