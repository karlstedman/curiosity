How business and mission are conducted in the space ecosystem has been static for decades. Progress has been primarily driven by Governmental money and the finicky focus of politics. This has resulted in the stagnation of humanity’s progress toward the stars. 

The good news is that this dynamic is changing rapidly. With the influx of private capital and focus, we are rapidly evolving the space ecosystem into a more dynamic and efficient organism. 

Much like the ’80s when the Internet’s foundation was laid which allowed the colossal impact we feel today in every facit of our lives, the foundational technology to not only exist in the inhospitable environment of space but thrive is being laid right now.  Within a few years, this foundation will allow a plethora of businesses to start building amazing technology that will impact every part of our lives, both in space and here on Earth. 

It is within that premise that Litepulse was born. We are building one of the aforementioned foundational technologies that are needed to thrive in space. 

We are extremely excited to be participating shaping in this historical time. If you would like to [join our journey](http://litepulse.com) or just watch as history is main we welcome you to do so [here](http://litepulse.com).
