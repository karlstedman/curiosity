There is a massive shift happening right now in the Space ecosystem. A shift from Governmental driven focus and priorities, to a more privately driven one. This multi-decade shift is monumental in nature and the size of the impact is on course to ***challenge the internet*** as the **most impactful economic change*** in humanityâ€™s history. 

The reason behind this statement is very simple, it is one of the resources available. Yes, the internet is massive, however, the net itself is constrained by the underlying building blocks of its systems. The storage and processors are in turn constrained by the available resources that EARTH itself has. ***Earth as a planet is small, and even our Sun is small by astronomical standards***. Thus, by starting to harvest the resources outside of our own planet we unlock a truly massive amount of potential. 

We are moving from an expensive bespoke space economy to one of mass production, economies of scale, and efficiency. Governmental contract-driven missions will continue to comprise large portions of the market, however, the private market/capital will quickly outgrow the governmental portion. This shift is essential to not only achieve the aims of ***making humanity a multi-planet species but will unlock the true economic potential that space has to offer***.
