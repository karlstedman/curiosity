It seems like everywhere we turn these days there is a headline depicting the coming age of the destruction of the human-based workforce. AI art, automated factories, and many more examples come to mind and ***it may seem like your job isn‚Äôt safe anymore, and you‚Äôre right***‚Ä¶

***It isn‚Äôt***‚Ä¶

Most likely the job you have right now will not look the same or will not be a job at all in 10 years, ***AND THAT IS A GOOD THING***. We as a species have a tendency to believe that the current circumstances will continue in a linear fashion into the future. This cannot be farther from the truth.

The only constant is change, so it‚Äôs time to embrace that change. It‚Äôs time for our economy and society to start teaching creating skill sets and problem-solving. These two types of skill sets will never be automated out or taken over by the coming ‚ÄúAI Overlords.‚Äù Instead of dreading the coming change, start to ***reframe your modality to what problems do I see here, and how can I solve them?***

The aforementioned frame of mind is true freedom because regardless of the situation you find yourself in you will be able to improve it. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are broke, unemployed, or homeless, you will be able to ***overcome the circumstances***. How do I know? Because I have been there‚Ä¶ 

***Homeless ‚àö***

***Broke ‚àö‚àö***

***Unemployed ‚àö‚àö‚àö***

Been there, done that. It's difficult yes, AND it's not the end of the world. I got out of my bad situation by talking a random indiviudal at Starbucks into investing 100k during November 2008, at the height of the Great Recession. If I could do it then, you can do it now... 

My old mentor Ryan Blair once told me when communicating with him, to bring the solution first and then state the problem. He didn‚Äôt want his time wasted with problems, he was enabling me to solve them and then bring the results. This thought process has proved priceless in dealing with all types of situations. Its is how I expect individuals I work with to think and behave as well. 

So stop fearing the future and start working to build the skill set to embrace all the possibilities that come with far more efficient systems. ***The world, no the solar system is your oyster***. üòâ
